# The Inception phase

The first of four phases in our project management process is called Inception. 

The Inception phase is concerned with risks related to the project's **objectives**, or *what* we are trying to do: project definition and scope, possibility, cost effectiveness, and completion date.

Specifically, you need to gather and record information showing:

- that all success-critical <u>stakeholders</u> are known, participating, and heard;
- that all of their <u>win conditions</u> are known; and
- that the project is <u>feasible</u> because there is at least one way to satisfy all win conditions.

In a professional setting, an organization would allocate the least amount of people and other resources needed to try to gather this information.

In this course, the Inception phase is related to the drop-add period. During this time, you can drop the course without penalty. If you do not, then by default you are making a greater investment by permanently enrolling in the course: something will be recorded on your transcript.

So, you should try to complete the Inception phase before drop-add ends. If success is in doubt, you still have the option of ending the project without investing further time or effort.

But the Inception phase doesn't automatically end just because you are still on the roster at the end of drop-add. Like all phases, it ends when success-critical stakeholders agree that risks related to this phase are low enough to move to the next phase, or that the risks cannot be lowered enough and the project should end.

## Success-critical stakeholders

1. Instructor: Steve Mattingly
2. Student: <!--student name -->
3. <!--Others? (usually not)--> 

## Win conditions

### for Steve Mattingly

1. The student must organize a "portfolio" of work that demonstrates achievement of each Learning Outcome on the course syllabus.
2. The student must demonstrate the ability to provide and apply appropriate feedback to improve work products. 
3. Course-related activities must satisfy requirements of academic and professional ethics.
4. The student must provide critical evaluation of their "portfolio" contents.
5. The student must "package" selected work products for one or more audiences of non-critical stakeholders.
6. Throughout the semester, the student must regularly submit work products that demonstrate progress toward satisfying these win conditions. 

### for <!--student name -->

<!-- Edit this section to list your win conditions. What will it take to make the course a "win" for you? To get you started, there are some common examples drawn from student motivators and concerns. Modify or remove them as appropriate. 
Then remove this instructions comment. -->

1. I must feel Competent-- that I know what I am doing.
2. I must feel Connection to other students, and that the work is relevant to my plans and interests.
3. I must have some/a lot of Control over what I accomplish in the course-- to feel that I control my own destiny.
4. I must achieve a grade of at least a B+.
5. I must feel as though i have enough knowledge in the program I am studying.
6. I must show prowess in this field.
7. I must know that I have given all that I can towards acheiving these win conditions.<!--?--> .

 <!-- Add subsections for each additional success-critical stakeholder, listing their win conditions. (Usually there are none.)
.
Then remove this instructions comment. --> 

## Feasibility

<!-- In this section, you need to address two issues.
.
First, are there any conflicts among the win conditions identified above? Either say that there are none, or list them. If you list any, explain how great the risk is and how the conflict might be addressed.
.
Second, is it wise to invest further time and effort in the project? *You* must decide if the course is do-able for you this semester, and if that is something that you want to do this semester. Since you are registered, the answer is probably "yes", but a drop or withdrawal is sometimes worth considering.

## Stakeholder review decisions

<!-- Periodically, success-critical stakeholders meet to review project status and select one of three options for the project's future. The number of these review meetings will vary by project and phase, so the subsection described below may need to be repeated-- once per review meeting. Do not remove the following instructions comments until the final review meeting for this phase is complete. -->

### <!--meeting date --> 

<!-- Remove two of the following three statements, leaving the one that describes the stakeholders' decision.
.
All success-critical stakeholders agreed to spend no more resources and end the project, because the risks to achieving a win-win outcome are too high.
.
All success-critical stakeholders agreed to commit a higher level of resources and move to the next phase, because this phase's list of risks to achieving a win-win outcome are at an acceptable level.
.
All success-critical stakeholders agreed to continue spending resources at the same level and remain in the this phase, gathering more information for future consideration. -->
